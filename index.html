  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="about fade-in">
    <h3>How I think</h3>
    <p>
      My work is grounded in the belief that innovation succeeds only when it is human-centred,
      strategically grounded, and future-oriented. With a background spanning Computational Social Systems,
      International Business, and Sustainability & Digitalization, I approach challenges systemically —
      identifying patterns, connecting stakeholders, and designing actionable solutions that balance impact,
      feasibility, and long-term value.
